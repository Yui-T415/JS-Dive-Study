## 📎 About Me

### **Background**:

I am from Mexico City, I studied a Degree in Interactive Design and I know HTML, Bootstrap and CSS.
Also, I studied UI/UX Design in CICCC last year and right now I am working for my mom company doing my coop,
so I am designing the webpage of our company and then I'll create the website.
And my hobby is to play the piano.

<br />

## 🎬 My Motivation

- I want to practice JS to reinforce what I'm learning in class.

  <br />

## 🔭 My Expectations

- My goals are to understand JS as much as I can and to know how to use git and github more.
