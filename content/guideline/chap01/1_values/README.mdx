# ü™ô Chapter 01 - 1: Study Guide ‚Äì Values, Data Types, and Operations

Welcome to **Chapter 01 - 1**! <br/> This guide will help you explore **values**, their **characteristics**, and how they are used in **operations**. <br /> Follow the structure below to study and document your understanding.

<br />

## **üóíÔ∏è Study Note**

### **1. Values**

Values are the foundation of any JavaScript program. <br /> Everything in your code revolves around values, which represent pieces of data.

- **What to Study**
  ```
    - What is a value in JavaScript?
    - How do values represent data in your program?
  ```

<br />

### **2. Data Types**

To work effectively with values, you need to understand their types. <br /> JavaScript divides values into two broad categories: **primitive types** and **reference types**. <br /> Each type behaves differently and has unique characteristics.

#### **2.1 Primitive Types**

Primitive types are the simplest forms of data in JavaScript. <br /> These types are immutable and stored directly in memory, making them easy to use but limited in flexibility.

- **What to Study**:
  ```
  - The seven primitive types in JavaScript
  - Characteristics of primitive types with examples (e.g., immutability).
  ```

#### **2.2 Reference Types**

Unlike primitives, reference types (e.g., objects and arrays) allow complex structures and behave differently in memory.

<br />
Understanding their mutability is key to working with them efficiently.

- **What to Study**:
  ```
  - What are reference types, and how do they differ from primitives?
  - Concepts of mutability and immutability.
  - The difference between shallow and deep copies.
  ```

<br />

### **3. Operations**

Once you understand the types of values in JavaScript, the next step is to see how they behave during operations, especially when type coercion is involved. <br /> Type coercion can lead to surprising results when values are combined or compared.

#### **3.1. Arbitary Operations**

- **What to Study**:
  ```
  - Operators (+, -, *, /, %)
  ```

#### **3.2. Comparison**

- **What to Study**:
  ```
  - Logical Operators
  - The difference between '==' and '==='
  ```

#### **3.3 Type Coercion**

- **What to Study**:
  ```
  - The difference between implicit and explicit type coercion.
  - How type coercion works in operations like addition, subtraction, and comparison.
  ```

<br />

### **4. Reflection**

Take a moment to reflect on what you‚Äôve learned:

- Write one or two things you found surprising or challenging this part.
- Write down any questions or topics you‚Äôd like to explore further
