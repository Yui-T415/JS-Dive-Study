# üêö Chapter 01 - 2: Study Guide ‚Äì Variables and Scope

Welcome to **Chapter 01 - 2**!  
This guide will help you explore **how JavaScript manages variables**, from **declaration to execution**.  
Follow the structure below to study and reinforce your understanding.

<br />

## **üìå Overview**

In JavaScript, **variables** store and manage data during program execution.  
Understanding how variables work is fundamental to writing maintainable and bug-free code.

This chapter covers:  
‚úî **Declaring Variables**: The differences between `var`, `let`, and `const`.  
‚úî **Scope**: How variables are accessed in different parts of a program.  
‚úî **Hoisting & Execution Context**: How JavaScript processes variables before execution.

<br />

## **üìñ Concepts**

### **1. Declaring Variables Properly**

JavaScript provides three ways to declare variables: **`var`**, **`let`**, and **`const`**.  
Each has different behaviors in terms of **scope, reassignment, and hoisting**.

#### **What to Learn**:

```
- Differences between var, let, and const.
- When to use let vs. const.
- Common pitfalls with variable declarations.
```

<br />

### **2. Scope**

**Scope** defines where a variable can be accessed in the code.  
JavaScript has three main types of scope:

- **2.1 Global Scope**

  - Variables declared outside any function or block **can be accessed from anywhere**.

- **2.2 Function Scope**

  - Variables declared inside a function **cannot be accessed outside that function**.

- **2.3 Block Scope**

  - Variables declared with `let` or `const` inside `{}` **exist only inside that block**.

- **2.4 Combined Scope**
  - Variables in different scopes interact with each other in a predictable way.

#### **What to Learn**:

```
- How global, function, and block scope work.
- The difference between var (function-scoped) and let/const (block-scoped).
- How different scopes interact.
```

<br />

### **3. Execution Context & Variable Lifecycle**

JavaScript processes variables in **three phases**:

1. **Declaration** ‚Üí Memory is allocated.
2. **Initialization** ‚Üí `var` is set to `undefined`, while `let` & `const` remain uninitialized.
3. **Assignment** ‚Üí The actual value is assigned.

Understanding this helps avoid issues related to **hoisting** and **the Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)**.

- **What to Learn**:
  ```
  - The three phases of variable lifecycle.
  - What hoisting is and how it affects var, let, and const.
  - Why accessing let/const before declaration results in a ReferenceError.
  ```
